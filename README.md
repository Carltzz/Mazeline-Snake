# Mazeline

A very simple game engine (now being transferred to BTekEngine) capabale of rendering 2D/3D.
There's a nice little Snake game in the project as well, but do note it requires shaders/snake textures for it to run (which I have lost but will re-add since it's not difficult)

The CMakeLists.txt should be configured already and will build the project perfectly fine - however do note this is for Windows only, I have not tested it on macOS/Linux.
